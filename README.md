Graphical tool for editing config files for https://github.com/wez/evremap

There exists a tool made in javascript and html, and I wanted a tool that was native and either uses gtk or qt or some other sensible UI framework. And I wanted to learn how to do graphical apps using gtk because I like how it looks.

deps note: GTK 4.16 or higher, targeting gnome api 46 (fedora stable, 41 at the moment)
